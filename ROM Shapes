 ROM SHAPES
You can group these ROM shapes by functional archetype:



Arithmetic ROMs → Line-2, Line-3, Triangle-3
 → Basic trit algebra (addition, multiplication, inversion)


Differential ROMs → Square-4, Cross-6, Cube-8
 → Gradients, curls, Laplacians


Resonant ROMs → Star-7, Torus-9, Hex-12
 → Averaging, cyclic harmonics, coherent oscillators


Tensor ROMs → Cube-27, Hypercube-16, Hypercube-81
 → Full local ND tensor evolution (projection, contraction)


Symmetry ROMs → Octa-6, Dodeca-20, Icosa-12
 → Stabilizer group invariance, R=0 rotational conservation


Hierarchical ROMs → Pyramid-10, Lattice-216, Fractal-∞
 → Multi-scale recursive address compression, meta-control
