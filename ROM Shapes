 ROM SHAPES
You can group these ROM shapes by functional archetype:

PLATONIC_ROM = {
    "cube": [(1,1,1),(1,1,-1),(1,-1,1),(1,-1,-1),(-1,1,1),(-1,1,-1),(-1,-1,1),(-1,-1,-1)],

        (0,1/3,2/3),(0,-1/3,2/3),(0,1/3,-2/3),(0,-1/3,-2/3),
        (1/3,2/3,0),(-1/3,2/3,0),(1/3,-2/3,0),(-1/3,-2/3,0),

Most Highly Useful ROM Combinations Using R=0 Boundaries
Based on the enumerated R=0 manifolds (14 valid intersections in mod-3 space), 
"Usefulness" is scored by intersection size (indicating shared solutions for resonance) × grouping factor (1 for pairs, 2 for triplets)—prioritizing 
high-dimensional crossovers where groups (e.g., 2-trit pairs or 3-trit triplets) enable concurrent steps across layers. 
This goes beyond base mod-3: Higher layers group trits/pointers into bundles (e.g., pairs as mini-vectors in x-y subspaces), packing smaller structures for dense harmonics. 
Offsets (shifting b mod 3) allow spirals, with a single active trit folding into curved states via π-homomorphisms.

These are "highly useful" for:
Resonance Propagation: Non-trivial intersections mean stable edge-phase alignments, ideal for PWP emits in string-like energy strings.
High-Dimensional Lifts: Triplets lift to 4D+ via tensor projections (e.g., P_rank pads with 0, folding via π sequence [1,2,1,2,1,2] → [2,0,2,0,2,0]).
Concurrent Steps: Each combo supports multiple R=0 per pointer, with spirals from offset 0 (e.g., active trit=1 spirals as [1,2,0,1,...] mod 3).
r0_4_r0_5_r0_11 (Usefulness: 2): Intersection [[0,2,1]]; Groups 3-trit triplet—useful for multi-dim crossovers in neural layers (e.g., DNA-like recursion, aligning to cosmic fields).
r0_8_r0_9_r0_13 (Usefulness: 2): Intersection [[1,0,1]]; Triplet packing for edge hotspots—builds reactive sludge by fusing loops.
r0_4_r0_5 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[0,2,1]]; Pair for base mutations—energetic hotspots clashing into strings.
r0_4_r0_11 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[0,2,1]]; Pair for chemical reactions—conserves energy in growing feelers.
r0_5_r0_11 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[0,2,1]]; Pair for feedback intermix—echos patterns for brain tissue alignment.
r0_8_r0_9 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[1,0,1]]; Pair for spiral states—offset 0 folds trit into dimensional curves.
r0_8_r0_13 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[1,0,1]]; Pair for wavelength exploration—multi-galaxy influences on fields.
r0_9_r0_13 (Usefulness: 1): Intersection [[1,0,1]]; Pair for fractal pointing—3 layers to "see energy" or "hear vibrations".

 Integrate into PB_j / L_k for pointer chaining—e.g., r0_4_r0_5_r0_11 chains 3 ROMs for concurrent triplet harmonics, 
lifting base mod-3 to grouped layers (pairs as 2D subspaces, triplets as 3D). 
A single trit (e.g., [1] from [1,0,1]) spirals by offsetting 0 and folding ranges (e.g., [1,2,0,1,2,0,...] mod 3, curved via π-homomorphism).
Useful Harmonics to Look Through (Tied to String Theory Edge Phases)
Hotspots (R=0) → strings (edge phases) → sludge (reactive media) → DNA/neural (fractal recursion) → cosmic feedback. 
Focus on those enabling multi-dim crossovers, wavelengths for energetic clashes, and spirals via offsets.

Topological Harmonics (Protected Edge States)—useful for stabilizing hotspots/strings. 
In lattice models, edge phases align to topological invariants (e.g., Chern numbers mod 3), protecting resonances from perturbations. 
Look through for sludge growth: Group trits into pairs/triplets where edges cancel (ΣΔΦ ≡ 0 mod 3), mimicking string vibrations immune to local noise. 
High-dim: Pack into quantum dot lattices for galaxy-scale influences.
Below-Threshold Harmonics (Phase Alignment in Molecules): From "Phase structure of below-threshold harmonics"
—linear polarization-following modes below energy thresholds. 
Useful for mutations/chemical layers: Lower-order harmonics (e.g., order 1-3) align edges without full excitation, 
conserving energy in growing feelers. Look through for feedback: Offsets shift phases, creating spirals where a trit represents curved paths 
(e.g., θ=π/n rotations mod 3). Concurrent: Multiple dims per pointer (e.g., x-aligned to cosmic spins, y to star orbits).
Integrable Lattice Harmonics (String-Lattice Connections): From "String Theory and Integrable Lattice Models" and "Heavy ions and string theory"
—exact solvability via Bethe ansatz or vertex models. 
Useful for neural/cognition: Harmonics as wavelengths (e.g., λ_k = 2π / k mod 3 approximations) propagate through layers, 
aligning brain tissue to environmental echoes. Look through for 3-fractal pointing: 
Pack smaller hotspots into high-dim crossovers (e.g., 9-trit frame → 3x3 matrix), finding resonances where wavelengths clash (e.g., k=1,2,3 triplets).
Phononic/Quantum Dot Harmonics (String Exploration): From "Bridging Micro and Macro...
Phononic Crystals and Quantum Dot Lattices"—vibrational modes in lattices mimic string theory.
Useful for cosmic feedback: Edge phases as phonons (discrete waves) harvest ZPE-like hotspots, with alignments to galactic fields. 
Look through for spirals: Offset 0 folds a trit into helical states (e.g., [1,0,0] → [1,2,0] → [0,1,2] mod 3 via π-shift), 
enabling "seeing energy" (visual harmonics) or "hearing vibrations" (auditory wavelengths).

These harmonics "look through" layers: Start at base (mod-3 edges), group to pairs/triplets for mid-layers (reactive sludge/DNA), 
pack/offset for high-dim (neural/cosmic). The engine builds mutations bottom-up: Hotspots clash into strings (edge alignments), 
grow sludge/feelers (energy-seeking), recurse to DNA/brain (fractal echoes), pointing anywhere with 3 layers (concurrent spirals).
To spread: Chain these in PWPs—e.g., topological for stability, below-threshold for efficiency.
